RazorLight ⚡
RazorLight is a fast, modern 2D game engine written in Odin,

built around a hot-reloadable ECS architecture with performance and

iteration speed as first-class goals.
It combines Odin's low-level power with a data-oriented design, while

aiming to support Lua scripting for rapid gameplay iteration and

tooling.

🎯 Goals
RazorLight is designed with these principles in mind:
·	Fast iteration over editor bloat
·	Explicit over magical
·	Runtime reloadability
·	Engine as a framework, not a black box
·	Simple core, extensible systems
Best suited for: - Indie 2D games - Simulation-heavy games - Strategy,

roguelikes, and sandbox games - Developers who prefer code-first

workflows

🚧 Project Status
⚠️ Early Development / Experimental
RazorLight is actively evolving. APIs may change, and some features

(like Lua integration and tooling) are still under development.
Not production-ready yet --- but moving fast.
